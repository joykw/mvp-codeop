## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

Be ready to defend your choices (e.g. why you chose certain technologies or made product decisions):
--> used the google map API key 
--> preferred react because I found it much better to include much with it

Be ready to talk about what you learned through this process.
-->That I need to get comfortable with 'react' routers
--> 

Each presentation should be no longer than 10 minutes. Be sure to address the following points:
High level of what the app is; 
-->Easy for a potential client to find a lawyer near them
-->using google maps should show name of firm, fee per hour

Why you made it (ie use case, who would use it)?
To help clients find affordable lawyers
-->To help new law firms get clients easily


What technologies you used to build it (don’t leave anything out - from design to implementation)?
What were the major steps taken to build it (ie the process)?
Potential future features in a second iteration.
What was most challenging?
What you feel most proud of?
